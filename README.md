# Kramulon-White-Paper

Kramulon is an ERC-20 token based cryptocurrency that allows users to invest in Real Estate that the Kramulon company owns. The mission of the cryptocurrency is to allow owners of our crypto to trade Kramulon directly for real estate. That was the initial mission and still is the main mission. A side mission of ours is also to broker the deals of tangible assets for all cryptocurrencies not just Kramulon. We have also delved into the idea of issuing the certificate of ownership of fractional real estate as a non-fungible token(NFT).

The Team

As of the ideation phase the sole owner/team member is Tariq Booker. A young real estate agent in the state of Georgia who owns the skate brand SK8-T-L. Has experience in taking ideas to market through business formation and trademarking names. Has sold a number of branded skateboards to skateshops all around the metro Atlanta area. Now in school for his real estate broker's license to become a real estate broker in the state of Georgia as well.

Kramulon is the future of real estate allowing users to invest in real estate with cryptocurrency. Hi my name is Tariq Booker and I am the founder of Kramulon. I am a skateboarder, and I own SK8-T-L which has previously done sales in retail skate shops in Atlanta. I am also a licensed real estate, and have been one for the last three years. I have been licensed since the age of 19, with my first home sold at 20. I am most recently a cryptocurrency enthusiast buying my first dogecoin in 2018. 

Kramulon is a real estate as a service (REAAS) company that addresses the issue of the difficulty of property ownership. Our solution is a cryptocurrency that allows for fractional shares of rental properties, or entire properties given a sufficient budget. This is possible through a certificate of ownership distributed upon the purchase of our crypto. This certificate can double as a non-fungible token (NFT). Our direct competitor propy is already doing this so it is possible. What makes us different is that we offer a cryptocurrency that appreciates in value. We are looking to raise $100,000 to purchase our first property(ies). Properties purchased will be sold back to users for crypto. No revenue other than our token has been generated. The token is already minted and will hit multiple exchanges on May 10th, 2022. These exchanges include Coinbase, Uniswap, and Pancakeswap. Our team members, including myself, were required to read “Launch an ICO & Token Crowdsale”, “How to Launch an ICO”, and “ICO Tutorial...”. Kramulon is also known as Kramulon Capital LLC, cryptoforhomes.io, cryptoforproperty.io, cryptoforhouses.io and cryptoforhomes.com. 

The homes we purchase will not yet be purchased with crypto until title companies start to recognize crypto as consideration for a home/property. The markets we wish to invest in are Alabama, and Georgia. Our target market is first time home buyers, crypto enthusiasts, real estate investors, and college students. 

Kramulon is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, and is available on the ethereum mainnet.

Real estate is a 10 trillion dollar market and crypto is a 1.6 billion dollar market. With that being said you can see an average of a 10% return on your money on the real estate side. On the crypto side when demand is higher than supply you can see returns as high as 1200%

With that being said we hope we have excited you into seeing kramulon rise to the moon.


I have decided to include an article on what is an ERC-20 token at the end of this white paper.

What Is ERC-20 and What Does It Mean for Ethereum?

By NATHAN REIFF Updated September 05, 2020

The popular cryptocurrency and blockchain system Ethereum is based on the use of tokens, which can be bought, sold, or traded. Ethereum was launched in 2015, and since then it has become one of the driving forces behind the popularity of cryptocurrency. In the Ethereum system, tokens represent a diverse range of digital assets, such as vouchers, IOUs, or even real-world, tangible objects. Essentially, Ethereum tokens are smart contracts that make use of the Ethereum blockchain.


KEY TAKEAWAYS
The popular cryptocurrency and blockchain system known as Ethereum is based on the use of tokens, which can be bought, sold, or traded.
One of the most significant tokens is called ERC-20, which has emerged as the technical standard used for all smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for token implementation.
Plenty of well-known digital currencies use the ERC-20 standard, including Maker (MKR), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Augur (REP), and OmiseGO (OMG).
What Is ERC-20?
One of the most significant Ethereum tokens is known as ERC-20. ERC-20 has emerged as the technical standard; it is used for all smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for token implementation and provides a list of rules that all Ethereum-based tokens must follow.


ERC-20 is similar, in some respects, to bitcoin, Litecoin, and any other cryptocurrency; ERC-20 tokens are blockchain-based assets that have value and can be sent and received. The primary difference is that instead of running on their own blockchain, ERC-20 tokens are issued on the Ethereum network.

ERC-20 Defines a Common List of Rules
As of October 2019, more than 200,000 ERC-20-compatible tokens exist on Ethereum's main network. The ERC-20 commands vital importance; it defines a common list of rules that all Ethereum tokens must adhere to. Some of these rules include how the tokens can be transferred, how transactions are approved, how users can access data about a token, and the total supply of tokens. 


Consequently, this particular token empowers developers of all types to accurately predict how new tokens will function within the larger Ethereum system. This simplifies the task set forth for developers; they can proceed with their work knowing that each and every new project won't need to be redone every time a new token is released, as long as the token follows the rules. This compliance is also necessary; it ensures compatibility between the many different tokens issued on Ethereum.

Fortunately, the vast majority of token developers have fallen in line with ERC-20 rules, meaning that most of the tokens released through Ethereum initial coin offerings are ERC-20 compliant.

Plenty of well-known digital currencies use the ERC-20 standard, including Maker (MKR), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Augur (REP), and OmiseGO (OMG). If you are planning on purchasing any digital currency that's issued as an ERC-20 token, you must also have a wallet that is compatible with these tokens. Luckily, because ERC-20 tokens are so popular, there are many different options for wallets.

ERC-20 Specifies Six Different Functions
ERC-20 defines six different functions for the benefit of other tokens within the Ethereum system. These are generally basic functionality issues, including the method in which tokens are transferred and how users can access data regarding a particular token.

Taken together, this set of functions and signals ensures that Ethereum tokens of different types will all uniformly perform in any place within the Ethereum system. As such, nearly all of the digital wallets which support the ether currency also support ERC-20-compliant tokens. But because the ERC-20 standard remains relatively nascent, there will likely be bugs that need to be ironed out. To cite an example of one such past glitch: Ethereum tokens sent directly to a smart contract used to lose money, because an error in the protocol meant that a token's contract could not respond to an attempt to make a direct transfer, resulting in the "loss" of the money associated with that transfer.
